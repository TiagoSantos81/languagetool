This is a **LanguageTool** fork, an Open Source proofreading software for English, French, German,
Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and [more than 20 other languages](https://languagetool.org/languages/).

Due to increased hostility related to development divergences, the need for another fork arose. 
Since late 2017, LanguageTool has had its development constrained by several factors, namely the 
conflict of interests inherent to the existence of a Freemium sister project and the integration 
of contributors owning other derivative commercial projects.

This fork intends to be a **pure free and open-source software** 'editor', developed for [end users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user), so, 
it enables several rules that were not allowed to be enabled by default in the open-source component, 
and adds rules that could be disabled on the grounds of being 'too picky' by some elements of the 
former team.

Future work may also involve rolling back Freemium API bindings, making the add-ons work entirely 
offline, and replacing n-gram rules by faster and lighter XML or [word2vec](https://github.com/gulp21/languagetool-neural-network) alternatives that can be 
shipped with the main package.

Everyone is still welcome to use and comment on this code according to the licencing terms, but feedback 
will only be considered if it has the end-users best interests in mind.

## Scripted installation and building
To install or build using a script, simply type:
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TiagoSantos81/languagetool/master/install.sh | sudo bash <options>
```

If you wish to have more options, download the install.sh script. Usage options follow:

```
sudo bash install.sh <options>

Usage: install.sh <option> <package>
Options:
   -h --help                   Show help
   -b --build                  Builds packages from the bleeding edge development copy of LanguageTool
   -c --command <command>      Specifies post-installation command to run (default gui when screen is detected)
   -q --quiet                  Shut up LanguageTool installer! Only tell me important stuff!
   -t --text <file>            Specifies what text to be spellchecked by LanguageTool command line (default spellcheck.txt)
   -d --depth <value>          Specifies the depth to clone when building LanguageTool yourself (default 1).
   -p --package <package>      Specifies package to install when building (default all)
   -o --override <OS>          Override automatic OS detection with <OS>
   -a --accept                 Accept the oracle license at http://java.com/license. Only run this if you have seen the license and agree to its terms!
   -r --remove <all/partial>   Removes LanguageTool install. <all> uninstalls the dependencies that were auto-installed. (default partial)

Packages(only if -b is specified):
   standalone                  Installs standalone package
   wikipedia                   Installs Wikipedia package
   office-extension            Installs the LibreOffice/OpenOffice extension package

Commands:
   GUI                         Runs GUI version of LanguageTool
   commandline                 Runs command line version of LanguageTool
   server                      Runs server version of LanguageTool
```

## Alternate way to build from source

Before start: you will need to clone from GitHub and install Java 8 and Apache Maven.

Warning: a complete clone requires downloading more than 360 MB and needs more than 500 MB on disk.
This can be reduced if you only need the last few revisions of the master branch
by creating a shallow clone:

    git clone --depth 5 https://github.com/TiagoSantos81/languagetool.git

A shallow clone downloads less than 60 MB and needs less than 200 MB on disk.

In the root project folder, run:

    mvn clean test

(sometimes you can skip Maven step for repeated builds)

    ./build.sh languagetool-standalone package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-standalone/target/`.

    ./build.sh languagetool-wikipedia package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-wikipedia/target`.

    ./build.sh languagetool-office-extension package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-office-extension/target`, rename the `*.zip` to `*.oxt` to install it in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

Now you can use the bleeding edge development copy of LanguageTool `*.jar` files, be aware that it might contain regressions.
